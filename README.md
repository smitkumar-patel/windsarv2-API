API written in Express.js working with PostgreSQL Database for "https://github.com/smitkumar-patel/windsarv2" repository.

Code you will see here is meant to work with PostgreSQL but you can make it work with other database with some modification.

To use this API you need to install PostgreSQL and create an empty database. You can find create table and insert queries inside "Database Query" folder. Once you have tables created and the data inserted you need to add your database details to "index.js" such as database name, password and so on. Once done you can simply do "npm i" to install the node modules if not done then type "npm start" to run the server. The server will reload with every save so you don't need to manually stop the server and start it again when changes are made.
